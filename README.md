# Sokoban Clone
A clone of the popular Japanese game 'Sokoban' from 1981. The levels are not made by me (okay, the first one is but that doesn't count), all the others have been taken from here: https://github.com/begoon/sokoban-maps.

See the game in action here: https://imgur.com/gallery/apzREUB.

## How to get it??
Make sure you have Love2D installed: https://love2d.org/. Then download the sokoban.love file and double-click it.

## Controls
Arrow keys to move around. Escape key to go back or exit the game. Hitting r will restart the level. Use the space key to start the game and select the level you want to play! 

## No sound?
Yes, currently there are no sounds in this game. Feel free to contribute :) 

## What's next?
I'm thinking about adding another game mechanic so that the game is not a clone anymore.
